# Recipebook

This was a small solo project that I worked on using Angular.

### Here is the home page.

### You can search for a recipe in the database.

### Clicking on 'Add New Recipe' will route you to a reactive form where the user can create a new recipe. It has validation to ensure the user doesn't submit a blank form.

### The user may also delete a recipe.
